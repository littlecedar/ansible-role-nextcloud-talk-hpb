# Configuring Nextcloud Talk HPB

This role deploys a Nextcloud Talk high-performance backend (HPB) on one node:
the `nextcloud-spreed-signaling` server, the Janus MCU and NATS as their message bus.

It does **not** deploy coturn or Traefik. Those two are operator-provided and are
referenced only through the contract described below.

## Requirements

- Docker and systemd on the target host.
- The external proxy network (default `proxy`) created **before** the playbook runs.
- The TURN server running with the same TURN REST secret.
- Nextcloud with the Talk app.

The role expects `com.devture.ansible.role.playbook_help` and
`com.devture.ansible.role.systemd_docker_base` (provided by the MASH playbook) and
the `community.docker` collection.

## Container images

The role consumes three images built and published by this repository:

| Service | Default image | Pinned version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Janus | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb:1.4.3` | Janus `1.4.3` (`1f0b75ca`) |
| NATS | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb-nats:2.15.1` | NATS `2.15.1` (`b2fd3efc`) |
| Spreed signaling | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb-spreed:2.1.1` | Spreed `2.1.1` (`e7a8fb7a`) |

Overrides for the signaling and NATS images:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image` | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb-spreed:{{ nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image_tag }}` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image_tag` | `2.1.1` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image_pull` | `true` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image` | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb-nats:{{ nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image_tag }}` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image_tag` | `2.15.1` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image_pull` | `true` |

Overrides for Janus:

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image` | `ghcr.io/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb:{{ nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_tag }}` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_tag` | `1.4.3` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_self_build` | `false` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_self_build_repo` | `https://github.com/littlecedar/ansible-role-nextcloud-talk-hpb.git` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_self_build_repo_version` | `v1.4.3-0` |

Janus has no `_container_image_pull` toggle: its image is pulled unless
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_self_build` is `true`, in which case the
role clones `_self_build_repo` at `_self_build_repo_version`, builds it on the target
with `build/janus/Dockerfile`, and tags the result as `_container_image`. Only Janus
has this target-side self-build path; NATS and Spreed run published images, or local
images with the matching `*_container_image_pull: false`.

To upgrade NATS or Spreed, change `ARG NATS_VERSION`/`ARG NATS_COMMIT` or
`ARG SPREED_VERSION`/`ARG SPREED_COMMIT` in the service Dockerfile, then update
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image_tag` or
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image_tag` in `defaults/main.yml` and the pin
tables in this guide and the README. The publish workflow derives its tags from the
Dockerfile ARGs; the role consumes the defaults tag. Janus upgrades are automated by
`update-janus.sh` and its weekly workflow.

The publish workflow builds all three images, runs their smoke tests and the molecule
scenario, and only then pushes to GHCR. It runs on pushes to `main` and on manual
dispatch. Every run pushes `sha-<short>`; `edge`, `latest` and the service version are
pushed only when the ref is `main`, so a manual dispatch on another branch pushes just
`sha-<short>`. CI builds and smoke-tests all three plus the molecule scenario on pull
requests and on manual dispatch, without pushing anything.

## Required variables

`nextcloud_talk_hpb_enabled: true` makes the role validate its configuration before
touching the host. These variables have no usable default and must be set:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_hostname` | Public hostname of the signaling server (also the Traefik `Host()` rule) |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_public_ip` | Host's public IP; Janus announces it as its 1:1 NAT mapping |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nextcloud_url` | Nextcloud base URL, for example `https://cloud.example.com` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_secret` | Shared secret with Nextcloud Talk (same value as `occ talk:signaling:add`) |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_turn_static_auth_secret` | TURN REST secret; must match the TURN server's |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_hash_key` | Session checksum key; 32 or 64 bytes recommended (other lengths only warn) |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_block_key` | Session encryption key; **must be 16, 24 or 32 bytes** (validated) |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_internal_shared_secret_key` | Authenticates internal signaling clients |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_token` | Shared bearer token: NATS accepts it and the signaling server presents it |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_uid` / `nextcloud_talk_hpb_gid` | Owner of the rendered support files |

Validation rejects: empty required values, an invalid `public_ip`, a
`nextcloud_url` without `http(s)://`, malformed subnets, a NATS address outside the
HPB subnet, an egress gateway outside the egress subnet, a malformed or inverted
`janus_rtp_port_range`, missing Traefik label values while labels are enabled, the
`allowall` backend mode without a secret, a missing external proxy network, and a
`compose.yaml` at the role root.

## Networks and subnets

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_hpb_network` | `nextcloud-talk-hpb-hpb` | Internal bridge; signaling + NATS |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_hpb_subnet` | `172.28.0.0/24` | Must contain `nats_container_ip` |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_ip` | `172.28.0.4` | Fixed so the signaling NATS URL is stable |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_egress_network` | `nextcloud-talk-hpb-egress` | Bridge; signaling + host-networking Janus |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_egress_subnet` | `172.29.0.0/24` | Janus WebSocket ACL |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_egress_gateway` | `172.29.0.1` | Janus WebSocket bind address |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_proxy_network` | `proxy` | External; never created or deleted by this role |
| `nextcloud_talk_hpb_proxy_network_subnet` | detected | Becomes the signaling `TRUSTED_PROXIES` |

If `hpb_subnet` or `egress_subnet` conflict with something already on the host,
override the subnet and its dependents together (`nats_container_ip`,
`egress_gateway`); validation rejects inconsistent values.

Deletion flags: `nextcloud_talk_hpb_hpb_network_deletion_enabled` and
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_egress_network_deletion_enabled` default to `true`.
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_proxy_network_deletion_enabled` exists for a possible future
migration and has no effect: the external proxy network is never removed.

## Secrets

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32   # signaling_secret, turn_static_auth_secret, nats_token,
                       # signaling_internal_shared_secret_key
openssl rand -hex 16   # signaling_hash_key, signaling_block_key
```

In MASH these are derived from `mash_playbook_generic_secret_key` (see the README
snippet). The rendered support files live in `nextcloud_talk_hpb_base_path`
(`signaling.conf`, `janus.env`, `nats.conf`, `signaling.labels`); all are mode `0640`.
`signaling.conf` and `nats.conf` are mounted read-only, `signaling.labels` is used as
Docker's label file, and `janus.env` is passed as an environment file. The signaling
and NATS secrets stay in the mode-`0640` configuration files rather than in container
environment variables. The Janus TURN secret is in `janus.env` and is therefore
visible in `docker inspect` `Config.Env`; this role keeps all secrets out of journals,
command lines, container logs and world-readable files.

## External relay proxy (Traefik)

1. Create the external network before running the playbook: `docker network create proxy`.
2. Attach the operator's Traefik container to it (in MASH:
   `traefik_container_additional_networks_custom: ["{{ nextcloud_talk_hpb_proxy_network }}"]`).
3. Either let the role render Docker labels
   (`nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_labels_traefik_enabled: true`, the default),
   or set it to `false` and route manually.

The labels route `https://<hostname>/` to `<signaling_identifier>:8081`:

```text
traefik.enable=true
traefik.docker.network=proxy
traefik.http.routers.nextcloud-talk-hpb.rule=Host(`<hostname>`)
traefik.http.routers.nextcloud-talk-hpb.entrypoints=web-secure
traefik.http.routers.nextcloud-talk-hpb.tls=true
traefik.http.routers.nextcloud-talk-hpb.tls.certResolver=default
traefik.http.services.nextcloud-talk-hpb.loadbalancer.server.port=8081
```

There is no path prefix: the signaling server owns `/spreed`, `/api/v1/welcome`,
the backend endpoints, `/proxy` and the Janus event handler. Traefik must support
WebSocket upgrade and must send `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For`; the signaling
server trusts only `nextcloud_talk_hpb_proxy_network_subnet`.

The signaling container also publishes `127.0.0.1:8081` on the host, because the
host-networking Janus container posts its events to it. Never publish 8081 publicly.

## External TURN server (coturn)

Run coturn outside this role:

```sh
turnserver --use-auth-secret --static-auth-secret=<nextcloud_talk_hpb_turn_static_auth_secret> \
  --realm=<realm> --external-ip=<public ip> --min-port=49152 --max-port=65535
```

- Permit TURN TCP/UDP `3478` and the relay range (default `49152-65535`). That range
  must not overlap the Janus RTP range.
- Janus reaches the TURN server at `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_turn_server_host` /
  `..._turn_server_port` (default `127.0.0.1:3478`) and derives ephemeral TURN REST
  credentials from the shared secret.
- Nextcloud Talk supplies the public TURN/STUN URL to clients; configure it in the
  Talk admin settings (or `occ talk:turn:add` / `occ talk:stun:add`).

## Nextcloud wiring

After a deployment, register the signaling server with the Nextcloud container:

```sh
docker exec -u www-data <nextcloud_identifier> php occ talk:signaling:add \
  "https://<nextcloud_talk_hpb_hostname>" "<nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_secret>" --verify
docker exec -u www-data <nextcloud_identifier> php occ talk:signaling:list
```

Then add the external TURN and STUN servers in the Talk admin settings, using the
same TURN secret. The role does not modify Nextcloud.

## Firewall

| Port | Exposure |
| --- | --- |
| `443/tcp` | public (Traefik) |
| `20000-40000/udp` | public (Janus RTP/RTCP; host networking) |
| `3478/tcp+udp`, `49152-65535/udp` | public (your TURN server) |
| `8081`, `8088`, `8188`, `4222` | **not** public |

Janus binds its HTTP API to `127.0.0.1:8088` and its WebSocket transport to
`<egress_gateway>:8188`, with an ACL limited to the egress network. Janus matches ACL
entries as address *prefixes*, not CIDR networks, so the role derives `172.29.0.`
from `nextcloud_talk_hpb_egress_subnet`; this assumes a `/24` egress network (the
role's default). The host firewall must still drop both ports from public interfaces.
Janus runs with host networking because publishing a 20k-port UDP range through the
Docker userland proxy is not viable; if host networking is unacceptable, revisit the
topology instead of publishing the range.

## Operating

```sh
systemctl status nextcloud-talk-hpb-{nats,signaling,janus}
journalctl -u nextcloud-talk-hpb-nats -f
journalctl -u nextcloud-talk-hpb-signaling -f
journalctl -u nextcloud-talk-hpb-janus -f
```

All three containers log through systemd (`--log-driver=none`).
Restarting one unit recreates only that container. Changing a rendered support file,
a unit file or an image sets `nextcloud_talk_hpb_restart_necessary`, which the MASH
systemd service manager uses to restart the affected units.

`nextcloud_talk_hpb_enabled: false` (plus a playbook run) stops and removes the three
units, removes the role's own networks when their deletion flags are true, and
removes `nextcloud_talk_hpb_base_path`. The external proxy network is untouched.

## Troubleshooting

**An image cannot be pulled from GHCR.** The tag is not published yet, or the package
is not visible to the host. Publish it by running the publish workflow on `main`, or
build it locally (`docker build -t <image> build/<service>`) and set the matching
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_signaling_container_image` or
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_nats_container_image` with `*_container_image_pull: false`. Janus
has no pull toggle and is always pulled from `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image`
unless self-build is enabled, so a locally tagged image alone is not enough: set
`nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image_self_build: true` to build it from source on
the target, or point `nextcloud_talk_hpb_janus_container_image` at a registry image the
host can pull.

**The signaling server logs `Processing Janus events` never appear.** Janus must be
able to reach `ws://127.0.0.1:8081/spreed`: check that the signaling container
publishes `127.0.0.1:8081` and that Janus runs with host networking.
`journalctl -u nextcloud-talk-hpb-janus` shows the event handler connection errors.

**Janus starts but calls have no media.** Check the RTP range is reachable from
outside, `nextcloud_talk_hpb_public_ip` matches the host's real public address, and
the host firewall does not block `20000-40000/udp`.

**Nextcloud reports the signaling server as unreachable.** Verify the shared secret
matches on both sides (`occ talk:signaling:list`), that `nextcloud_talk_hpb_nextcloud_url`
is exactly the Nextcloud base URL, and that the signaling server can reach Nextcloud.

**`Could not create janus MCU: data channels are not supported`.** The signaling
server requires a Janus build with data channels. A third-party Janus image built with
`--disable-data-channels` connects and reports its version, then gets rejected. Use
this repository's image (data channels and `usrsctp` are enabled) or rebuild Janus
accordingly.

**TURN never succeeds.** Janus and Nextcloud must use the same TURN REST secret, and
the TURN server must be configured for TURN REST credentials (`--use-auth-secret`).
A static-credential TURN server does not work with the generated credentials.

**`a changed-users warning`** in the signaling log is normal after session resumption
and is non-blocking once calls work.
